# **what is Git?**
# * is the where i can store data in a file system . 
#### * Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot and stores a reference to it. 
### * If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.
### * is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files
## * Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git. 
### * Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.
